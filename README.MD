# TravelSync

## Problem
As passionate travelers, we understand the challenges faced by those who seek to immerse themselves in the diverse cultures of the world. While visiting iconic landmarks and trying local cuisines are integral parts of the travel experience, music often remains an overlooked avenue for cultural exploration. Many travelers find themselves unfamiliar with the local music scene, limiting their understanding of a country's creative expression.

This app addresses the aforementioned issue by presenting a solution for avid travelers. Acknowledging music as a universal language that transcends cultural boundaries, we perceive this challenge as an opportunity for exploration and connection.

## Motivation
Culture shock is a prevalent issue among travelers, often leading to misunderstandings and homesickness. To mitigate this, we aim to provide users with a glimpse into the music of a country, fostering a sense of connection with its artistic expression beyond the visual aspects of architecture and tourist attractions. **TravelSync** seeks to cultivate an appreciation for local music, contributing to a reduction in culture shock during a traveler's stay in a foreign country.

## Features

As your ultimate travel companion web app, **TravelSync** offers a user-centric experience from the moment you embark on your global adventures. Upon entering your name, the app stores your information in the database for personalized interactions.

### 2. Cultural Adventure Playlist
Designed for seamless integration with your travel experience, **TravelSync** prompts you to input both your home country and your destination. It then generates a curated playlist of songs, accessible through Spotify (individual songs only, compatible with both Free and Premium Spotify accounts). This feature provides a world-expanding view of music, introducing you to songs you might not have encountered otherwise.

### 3. Genre-Based Customization

The app fine-tunes its recommendations to align with your unique music tastes.

### 4. Playlist Flexibility
Flexibility is key, and **TravelSync** empowers you to decide the size of your playlist. Whether you prefer a short selection for quick plane rides or an extensive compilation for long-haul flights lasting 17 hours or more, the choice is yours. Tailor your musical journey to suit the duration of your travels.


## Data Overview

### 1. Source
The dataset utilized in TravelSync is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pepepython/spotify-huge-database-daily-charts-over-3-years) and is titled "Spotify HUGE database - daily charts over 3 years" by user "pepe." This dataset spans over 170,000 datapoints and is derived from Spotify's Daily Top 200 Charts across 35 countries, including global charts, from 2017 to 2020.

### 2. Dataset Characteristics
- **Duplicates:** The dataset initially contained duplicates due to similar songs appearing in different countries. To maintain uniqueness, we categorized the data by country, ensuring that not every country would have the same songs.
-  **Format:** The dataset is stored as a CSV (comma-separated values) file with various columns such as title, URI, country, popularity, artist, album, genre, and more.

### 3. Data Cleaning
After downloading the CSV file, we performed data cleaning to remove unnecessary columns. Columns like artist_followers, album, track_album, track_number, release_date, album/single, and others related to in-depth song classification were eliminated. The remaining columns were renamed for use in our application:
